          <p class="">I’ve become obsessed by the Wet Plate Process over the last few years—a 19th century process in which the image is hand made on a sheet of clear glass or on blackened metal.  The main reason for my interest is that the process requires attention to detail in order to get the required effects, along with a lot of chance. There are so many variables that one can’t always take account for, and so it’s a process where there is a good amount of controlled chaos at play.  As with many forms of photography, the frustrations are a many, and so when it works, it works beautifully.</p>

          <p>For me, a successful glass plate is one with a good range of tone, and enough of the curious anomalies that the 19th century photographers who used the process would have considered as the marker of a failure, but which many contemporary practitioners tend to like.  Such anomalies, like the empty black space in one corner where the glass plate is held, or the murkiness caused by an uneven pour of the emulsion or the developer, are the signature tell-tale hallmarks of the process.  Too many anomalies distract from the content of the image, however a few of these, and an interesting composition, make for a successful plate.  The end result is one where it is both a photographic image as well as an object.  The object nature of a photograph is of special interest to me.</p>

          <p>I guess that I’m one of those annoying photographers who doesn’t really identify as a photographer.  My background as a sculptor causes me to consider myself as a ‘maker of stuff’ rather than as someone who self-locates to a specific discipline.  Sometimes I feel like a bit of a fraud for not thinking of myself explicitly as a photographer, however such a fluid self-conception allows me a certain agency—from which I believe my current practice is derived.  When I learnt how to use wet plate process (which in my case consists of ‘ambrotypes’ because I use clear glass), I realised that the nature of the process and my specific interests meant that I had to build a mobile dark room, more formally known as a ‘darkbox’.  This is where my background as a sculptor—a maker of contraptions—came into play.</p>
